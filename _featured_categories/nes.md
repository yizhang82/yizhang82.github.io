[NesChan](https://github.com/yizhang82/neschan) is a Nintento Enterintament System (NES) emulator I wrote just for fun. Back in 2017, I was a bit burned out from a previous manager job and really misses writing code, so I was looking for a small-ish fun project. I came across this [medium post](https://medium.com/@fogleman/i-made-an-nes-emulator-here-s-what-i-learned-about-the-original-nintendo-2e078c9b28fe) and quite inspired by it. After reading nesdev wiki for a while I decided to give it a try mid-December 2017. It took me around week and half to get quite a few major titles perfectly (SMB, Super Contra, Shadow of the Ninja, etc). But it's still in its early stages and I don't have any intention to bring it to par to the mainline NES emulators like [Mesen](https://www.mesen.ca/) - I do have a day job to pay my bills and I also have a lot of new things to learn. But I did plan to write a series documenting how I implemented NESChan. If people find it interesting and informative, or even inspired to write their own NES emulator, I'd consider these time well spent.
