I'm planning to write about following topics - these are topics that I'm personally interested in:

* .NET (interop, garbage collector, type system, object layout, libraries, debugging)

* Runtime (CLR, JVM, CPython, etc)

* Language bindings (C#, Python, Go, Javascript)

* General programming languages (C++, C#, Go, Python, Rust), and functional programming languages (F#, Haskell, Scala)

* Database engines and key/value stores

* Data structures, especially concurrent, lock-free data structures

* Concurrency, multi-threading, async/await, coroutines

* Thoughts on general programming and project management
