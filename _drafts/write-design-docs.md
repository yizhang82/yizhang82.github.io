## How to write good design docs

1. Focus on the why, and less on the what/how

This is perhaps the most important point that I'm trying to make. It is easy to document all the nitty-gritty details about how things are done in a certain way, and how it is implemented. However, there is one thing better that documenting the implementation - that is the implementation itself! And it never gets out-of-date, as a bonus.

On the other hand, it is often much harder to understand *why* things are done in certain way from the code, which may include:

  * Options already explored that didn't work due to whatever reason

  * Assumptions being made back then which may or may not be true today

  * Using X integrates better with existing systems at that point

  * There was a big push for Y initiative across the company

2. Provide context/background/history

This is somewhat related to "Why" but is important enough that deserves its own section. Often times, when a feature is being developed, a project getting started, it is not being done in a vaccum. 


3. Evaluate your options

4. Capture the data and back it up

5. It captures It starts a conversation
