# My 2020 Pandemic Working From Home Setup

## Desk

I have a standing desk at work and it is amazing for back pain, so as soon as pandemic hits I decided to splurge for a standing desk as well. I went with [Uplift Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/). Assembly wasn't hard at all and the instructions were straight-forward. The desk is just really heavy. The only thing I didn't quite like about the desk is that it still wobbles a little bit when I type, most likely I didn't screw it tight enough in the legs, but it doesn't bother me that much so I just decided to fix that next time when I move.

## Monitor

I'm using [DELL UltraSharp U3818DW](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/accessories/apd/210-amrc?gacd=9646510-1028-5761040-266706306-0&dgc=st&ds_rl=1282789&gclid=CjwKCAiAirb_BRBNEiwALHlnD8l9VMSy28riLu1-4jitXHv6_2gV4kb4A8aIsJTtapnQM-mcNBgByRoCWVMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) which is a 38 inch ultrawide. This thing is a beast. Being ultrawide I can just use one USB-C cable to connect to my work-issued 16" MBP 2019. I used to have two Dell UltraSharp U2515H but using it with MBP is a hassel, so I gave up and went ultrawide. I can open 3 columns of tmux window side by side so I'm quite hapy with it.

The best part is, it also serves as a USB hub. So I have my mouse + keyboard connected to it and it'll automatically switch to my gaming PC or MBP whichever is on. It connects to MBP with USB-C and gaming PC with a USB cable + DisplayPort. Manually switching between doesn't work well when both are on, which I can live with. 

Gaming is amazingly immersive being an ultrawide and most games supports it well - but it needs a better card as it is WQHD 3840*1600 which is ~75% of 4K (3840x2160), so I upgraded to a nVidia 2080 for my gaming PC which I'll talk about later.

It is also great for watching movies if those are in the correct 21:9 format (without blackbar). I find iTunes movies generally works well for ulrawide. Netflix is hit or miss, and prime videos are almost always have blackbars and horrible.

It can charge up to 90W via USB-C - good enough for a MBP.

## Keyboard + Mouse

I *love* mechanical keyboards - the feel of typing them under your fingertips brings me a lot of joy. I remember in high-school our lab has a machine with a IBM type-M keyboard and I always do everything I can to hog that spot:

```gif:you are in my spot```

My latest favourite is [Massdrop CTRL keyboard](https://drop.com/buy/drop-ctrl-mechanical-keyboard). It is 70% TKL (Ten-keyless) so it is compact. It has RGB support. Supports both Windows and Mac. You can hot-swap different switches but the one I'm using at home is Blue switch. I also have a Brown switch version in case I'd like to bring it to office some day - but for WFH blue switch is better.

Before the pandemic hits, in open office I use [Vortexgear Race 3](https://www.amazon.com/Vortex-Race-Mechanical-Keyboard-Aluminium/dp/B087LZ8823/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Vortex+keyboard+race+3&qid=1609455022&sr=8-3) keyboard. It is less flashy (but I do like its retro white gray look and colorful key caps) with brown switch so people won't hate me. Typing feels really good on it despite being brown so I bought another one as a backup in case it went out. I don't feel the need to build my own mechanical keyboard and these two keyboard fit my needs pretty well. If I had one thing to change them I'd make them wireless (but not bluetooth).  

For Mouse I use a [Logitech MX Anywhere 2S mouse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VK5KXN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Feels great in my hand and works both as wireless and blutooth.

## Chair

I had a Ikea chair that worked well but is quite worn from a few years of use, so I end up getting a [Aeron Chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) which I quite like. It is definitely not cheap but considering the amount of time I spent on it it is well worth the investment. Even though I do have a standing desk you can't standing all day - you need to switch between sitting and standing every once in a while.

## PC and laptop 

For work I use MacBook Pro 16 2019 - it's a pretty beefy machine from my employer, though most of heavy lifting is done in remote dev machines. 

I build a new Gaming PC this year myself, using some spare parts (like graphics card, power supply, some SSDs) from my old i7-4770K build, and got new CPU/MB/RAM/Case. I went with AMD this time and it probably been 20+ years since last time I had AMD (IIRC it was a *Athlon* back in 98-ish):

When I build this PC it just stopped booting after installing latest AMD patches, and had to RMA everything until I replace the CPU - this never happened to me before! I wasn't too happy with its idle temp and noise - installing better cooler from bequite and noctua fixed them. The case feels a bit on the small side and I was too lazy to put additional hard drives on it, so I end up putting my hard drives in my old i7-4770k PC and now it functions as a NAS running on Ubuntu 20.04.

I also have a personal laptop [Lenovo X1 Carbon 7th gen](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x/X1-Carbon-Gen-7/p/22TP2TXX17G). I recently [put Fedora linux on it](/lenovo-fedora). I got it in late 2019 for upcoming travel (it weighs only 2.4lbs) but that turned out to be a horrible decision in 2020. 

## Other misc

I have a [Facebook Portal](https://portal.facebook.com/) for meetings. It is actually pretty amazing for that - great picture and speaker/microphone, the camera will zoom in and move around with you. It supports zoom meetings and blue jeans.

For audio [YU2 Kanto Speaker](https://www.amazon.com/Kanto-YU2-Powered-Desktop-Speakers/dp/B00GMPDB1W/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=Yu2%2Bkanto%2Bspeaker&qid=1609469517&sr=8-8&th=1). It is connected to my monitor so it auto connects to whichever computer I use. I used to have more complicated budget audio DAC+AMP+Speaker+Headphone setup but I don't use it much these days.

I use a [Omotion Laptop Stand](https://www.amazon.com/Vertical-Adjustable-OMOTON-Aluminum-Chromebook/dp/B0769G51R7/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=omotion+stand&qid=1609469866&sr=8-4) so that my MBP takes less space.
