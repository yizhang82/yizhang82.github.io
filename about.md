I'm a Microsoft developer working on Windows Azure focusing on building high-performance transactional data structures and strong type system for our storage solution across multiple languages. 

In my previous life I've been working on CLR (Common Language Runtime) for ~10 years, the virtual machine that powers Microsoft [.NET framework](http://dot.net), including full .NET Framework, [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), .NET Native, and [CoreRT](https://github.com/dotnet/corert). So don't sue me if I'm a bit biased towards C# and .NET. 

### Projects on github
